# Frequency Table
Is:

- Grouping of data into mutually exclusive classes
- Classes show number of observations
- Frequency can be:
  - Absolute: Number of observations
  - Relative: Number of observations, divided by total

# Bar chart

- X-axis is variable, Y-axis is frequency
- Can be absolute or relative
- Bars are not adjacent

# Frequency distribution

- For quantitative variables
- Classes are ranges
- Steps to build:
  - Define number of classes:
    - Not too few or too many
    - 2<sup>k</sup> > N, k is the number of classes, N number of observations
  - Define class range:
    - Range/k
    - Class range could be rounded to a convenient power of 10
