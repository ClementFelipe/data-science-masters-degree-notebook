# Statistics
In abstract, a tool to make decisions. A way to organize, analyse, transform and visualize data in order to make personal and/or administrative decisions.

There are two types of statistics: descriptive and statistical inference.

# Descriptive statistics
Is:

- A collection of methods to organize, analyse, present, summarize... data
- ***Not*** meant to make predictions or generate *future* data from existing data
- Useful for giving meaning to unorganized data, making it useful

Applications:

- Determining the usefulness of a **variable** for a model
- Data cleanup
- Determining ranges of data
- Finding variability of data
- Discovering atypical data

# Statistical inference (inferential statistics)
Is employed to determine properties from a **population** via a **sample** of it and an underlying **probability distribution**.

- Population: A collection of objects of interest obtained from **all** objects of interest **(example: all people on the planet -> males between 20 and 30 years old)**
  - Characteristics are called **parameters**
- Sample: A subset of the population
  - Characteristics are called **statistics**

# Variables
A characteristic of the object being studied. Can be qualitative (categorical, attribute) or quantitative (numerical).

## **Qualitative variables (categorical, attribute)**
Are:

- Non numerical quality of an object
- Relevant to categorization
- Representable via frequency tables, bar diagrams, etc

## **Quantitative variables (numerical)**
Are:

- Numerical quality of an object
- Representable via histograms, box plots, etc
- Can be:
  - Discrete: Have gaps between values, represent numerical relationship
  - Continuous: Can take any value in a given interval, represent a measurement

## **Scales of measurement**

- Classify variables
- Restrict what kind of calculations can be made
- Restrict what kind of statistical tests can be performed
- Can be (order of ascending information they provide):
  - Nominal
    - **Qualitative**
    - Useful for classifying (grouping) and counting
    - No order
    - Often assigned numerical id's
    - Mode can be calculated
  - Ordinal
    - **Qualitative**
    - Ordered
    - Magnitude between values is indeterminable
    - Median can be calculated
  - Interval
    - Quantitative
    - Includes properties of ordinal scale
    - **Difference** between values is constant
    - 0 is arbitrary, does not indicate absence of characteristic
    - Ratios do not make sense
    - Mean can be calculated
  - Ratio
    - Quantitative
    - Includes properties of ordinal scale
    - 0 indicates absence of characteristic
    - Ratios make sense


# Frequency tables, frequency distributions
Groups data into mutually exclusive classes that show observations.

Observations can be:

- Absolute: Number of observations
- Relative: Percentage of observations
