# Numeric measurements
Ways to describe quantitative data, which can be measures of central tendency or measures of dispersion.

### **Central tendency measures**
Are:

- Often called an average of data
- used to find the "center" of the data
- Not enough to make decisions over data (dispersion must be taken into account)

Can be:

- Arithmetic mean
  - **Sum of all values divided by the number of values**
  - Can be for:
    - Population: µ (result), N (population size)
    - Sample: Result: x̄ (result), n (sample size)
  - For non grouped data, no frequency distribution
  - **Parameter** of a population
  - The sum of the difference of all values with the mean is zero, represents point of equilibrium for data
  - May not represent data well depending on outlier/atypical data
- Weighted mean (x̄<sub>w</sub>)
  - Weights are frequencies of observations
- Median
  - Middle value of an ordered set of variables
  - Can be useful when mean is not
  - Atypical values (small/large) do not affect it
  - Applicable for ordinal data or higher
- Mode
  - Useful especially for nominal data types
  - Atypical values (small/large) do not affect it
  - A mode can not exist when observations do not repeat or repeat very little
  - Bimodal: Two modes
- Geometric mean

### **Dispersion measures**
Used to find the dispersion of data; methods include:

- Range
- Mean absolute deviation
- Variance
- Standard deviation

#### *Chebyshev theorem and empirical rule*

### **Measures for gouped data**
