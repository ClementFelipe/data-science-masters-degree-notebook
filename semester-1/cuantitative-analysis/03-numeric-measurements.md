# Numeric measurements
Ways to describe quantitative data, which can be measures of central tendency or measures of dispersion.

### **Central tendency measures**
Are:

- Often called an average of data
- Used to find the "center" of the data
- Not enough to make decisions over data (dispersion must be taken into account)

Can be:

- Arithmetic mean
  - **Sum of all values divided by the number of values**
  - Can be for:
    - Population: µ (result), N (population size)
    - Sample: Result: x̄ (result), n (sample size)
  - For non grouped data, no frequency distribution
  - **Parameter** of a population
  - The sum of the difference of all values with the mean is zero, represents point of equilibrium for data
  - May not represent data well depending on outlier/atypical data
- Weighted mean (x̄<sub>w</sub>)
  - Weights are frequencies of observations
- Median
  - Middle value of an ordered set of variables
  - Can be useful when mean is not
  - Atypical values (small/large) do not affect it
  - Applicable for ordinal data or higher
- Mode
  - Useful especially for nominal data types
  - Atypical values (small/large) do not affect it
  - A mode can not exist when observations do not repeat or repeat very little
  - Bimodal: Two modes
- Geometric mean (GM)
  - For relative values (percentages, rates, etc)
  - n<sup>th</sup> root of the product of all data
  - Always <= than arithmetic mean
  - All data must be positive
  - Rate of growth: n<sup>th</sup> root of division of last period by first

### **Dispersion measures**

- Used to find the dispersion of data
- Gives more complete image of data
- Used to find how representative a central tendency measure is
- Can be used to compare two distributions

Methods include:

- Range
  - Max value - min value
  - Only takes into account two values (disadvantage)
- Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
  - Represents mean deviation from the mean
  - Takes into account all values
  - Sum of all differences from the mean, divided by number of observations
- Variance
  - More sensitive to dispersion than MAD
  - Will result in squared units of the characteristic
  - Sum of all squared differences with the mean, divided by number of observations
  - Can be for:
    - Population (s<sup>2</sup>)
    - Sample (σ<sup>2</sup>): Subtract 1 from sample
- Standard deviation
  - Used to compare dispersion between two or more sets of observations
  - Same units as characteristic
  - Square root of variance

#### *Chebyshev theorem and empirical rule*

- Used to determine what percentage of the data is *k* products over and under than the mean
- Shape of the distribution is irrelevant
- 1 - 1/(k<sup>2</sup>)
#### *Variation coefficient*

- Standard deviation divided by mean
- Gives dispersion of data
- Empirical rule:
  - In normal distribution
  - 1 stdev -> 68% of data
  - 2 stdev -> 95% of data
  - 3 stdev -> 99.7% of data
- If range is known, stdev is approximately = range/6
