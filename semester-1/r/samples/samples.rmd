## Vectors

This section refers to one dimensional vectors of elements (arrays in other languages).

### Declaration

Possible ways include:

```{r vectors_declaration}
c(1, 2, 3)

1:3

seq(-3, -1, 0.2)

rep(1, 5)
```

### Access

Vector access receives an _index vector_ to decide the output.

```{r example vector}
x <- c(0:6, NA)
x
```

#### Intger index vector access

The way it works when an _integer vector_ is passed is basically telling R to "give me the elements oredered by the following index list", this index list:

  - Does not have to be shorter than the original list
  - Can repeat indexes

```{r integer_vector_access}
# First element - R is 1-idexed (:
x[1]

# Same element more than once
x[c(3, 3, 3, 3)]

# Last  3 elements
x[length(x) - 3:0]

# All elements except the first two
x[-c(1:2)]
```

#### Logical index vector access

_logical vectors_ have the following conditions:

  - If longer than the original vector, will produce `NA` for every boolean value in the index vector in a position `y > length(x)`
  - If shorter than the original vector, will repeat the index vector until exactly all elements of the original have been evaluated

```{r logical_vector_access}
# Shorter than the original vector
x[c(TRUE, TRUE)]

# Shorter than the original but with a false
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]

# Longer than the original
x[rep(TRUE, 10)]

# Elements not NA
x[!is.na(x)]

# Even elements
x[x %% 2 == 0]

# Even positive non NA elements
x[!is.na(x) & (x > 0) & (x %% 2 == 0)]
```

## Objects

Everything is an object (and all objects have length), they can have a primitive _type (mode)_ of:

  - numeric
  - complex
  - logical
  - character
  - raw
  
Other types are:

  - data.frame
  - list
  - array
  - matrix
  - factor
  
*Atomic* structures (vectors) consist of elements of the same mode.

*Recursive* structures (list, function, expression) possibly consist of elements of different modes.

```{r objects}
x <- as.data.frame(1:3)

length(x)
mode(x)

# Returns all non intrinsic properties (mode, length)
attributes(x)
```

Objects can be coerced into other modes (casting):

```{r casting}
x <- 1:3

as.character(x)
```

Get or set attributes
```{r get_set}
x <- as.data.frame(1:3)
x

# Get
attributes(x)
attr(x, "names")

# Set
attr(x, "names") <- c("aaa")
x
```

## Factors
